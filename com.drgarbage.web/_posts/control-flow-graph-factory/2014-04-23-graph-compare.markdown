Control flow graphs generated by [Control Flow Graph Factory][cfgf] are directed and unordered graphs
or digraphs. 

The maximum common subtree isomorphism task consist in finding of largest common subtree between two trees.
The trees can be derived either using Dr. Garbage graphical interface of graph development or extracted from byte/source code.

Control Flow Graph Factory Comparison offers 2 options to investigate similiarity between two trees graphically:

* [Top-Down MaxCommon subtree algorithm](#tda)
* [Bottom-Up MaxCommon subtree algorithm](#bua)


Top-Down MaxCommon Subtree Comparision  <a name="tda"></a>
--------------
The algorithm is based to find a maximum common subtree between two different trees T1 and T2 starting from root.

Bottom-Up MaxCommon Subtree Comparision  <a name="bua"></a>
----------------

The algorthm is constructed by such way, that the maximum common subtree is being searched starting from the leaves. The maximum similar subtree from the bottom is green highlighted.
